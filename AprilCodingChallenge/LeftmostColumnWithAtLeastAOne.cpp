/*
A binary matrix means that all elements are 0 or 1. For each individual row of the matrix, this row is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given a row-sorted binary matrix binaryMatrix, return leftmost column index(0-indexed) with at least a 1 in it. If such index doesn't exist, return -1.
You canâ€™t access the Binary Matrix directly. 

You may only access the matrix using a BinaryMatrix interface:
BinaryMatrix.get(x, y) returns the element of the matrix at index (x, y) (0-indexed).
BinaryMatrix.dimensions() returns a list of 2 elements [m, n], which means the matrix is m * n.

Submissions making more than 1000 calls to BinaryMatrix.get will be judged Wrong Answer. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.
